The NXTComm Processing library allows you to control the Lego Mindstorms NXT robots.

The following people have contributed to this library:

**Matt Cotter**

**Dave Musicant**

**Anton Vanhoucke**
Anton studied design and engineering and loves robots and lego. So he plays with Mindstorms. The cool stuff about robotics these days is that you can connect to everything: laptops, phones, web servers, camera's, raspberry pi's and arduino's. So that's what Anton builds. Because he can.
